            <h1>Why Empathy Builder?</h1>
            <blockquote class="quote" cite "http://www.freefrom.org/about">
                Without a way to rebuild financially, survivors typically won't leave an abuser. If they do, they risk homelessness, losing custody of their children, or having to return to their abuser.

            <p>Financial insecurity is the No. 1 reason survivors of domestic violence remain in or return to abuse. In order to break the cycle of violence, we must remove obstacles to financial security for survivors. To that end, <a href="http://www.freefrom.org/about">Freefrom.org</a> is developing an interactive calculator for their website. It will serve survivors to enable them to better understand the costs of leaving and staying safe. The calculator will include prompts to help users understand and identify the relevant costs. This project will not only help survivors and raise awareness of the costs of domestic violence, but will also capture valuable data that will help FreeFrom drive positive policy change!</p>
